# Spirited Away

Spirited Away is a audio/visual VR project that relies on A-Frame VR, Web Audio, and Web MIDI technologies.

The app is intended to "spirit away" musicians who use it to new environment for music inspiration.
Connecting a MIDI keyboard will allow you to play a simple synth.


### Required Devices
It requires a VR Headset and a USB MIDI keyboard to work any of the following below should work:

 - Oculus VR Headset
Simply connect it as normal and hook up a midi keyboard to one of the free USB ports.

- Gear VR
The Gear VR requires a bit of setup. First you must have a phone for the headset, and an adapter for a USB MIDI keyboard
to connect to the USB-C port located underneath the headset.

 - Google Cardboard
Good for viewing, but using this makes you lose out on using a MIDI keyboard.
